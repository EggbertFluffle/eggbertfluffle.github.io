internet’s oldest tradition, neocities. Essentially, neocities is just a
bunch of retro, internet personal websites that people make to talk
about themselves, share gifs, show art, blog, connect with others, and
honestly anything imaginable. Most of the time these sites are
completely static and I usually find sites through <a href="https://neocities.org/">neocities.org</a>. Neocities the site
offers static hosting for free (while the site stays under 1GB of
storage). This is great because I can host my site on neocities at <a href="https://eggbert.neocities.org">eggbert.neocities.org</a> for
completely free. This is great and feels similar to GitHub pages and
they also offer <a href="https://neocities.org/tutorials">tutorials</a>
for things like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that could prove useful to
anyone interested in building their little corner of the internet.`,b,n,H="Social aspect",w,m,L=`Some get incredibly creative with the sites, but what sticks out to
me is the robust social systems these completely independent sites have.
There are so many methods of contacting others and I’ll just leave a
short synopsis of those here because it’s honestly very impressive.
These are completely independent minds that have all more or less
agreed-upon methods of linking pages and having a social network within
their neocities.`,v,a,M=`<li>Regular old links: The obvious one. Just a link to another page.
Littered all across these neocities.</li> <li>88x31 buttons: These are probably the most creative in my opinion.
Essentially if you wanted to, you would create a little 88 x 31 pixel
gif with some animated art that would link back to your website and
leave it on your website for people to take. What that means is that
people who like your site will take your button and put it on their own
so that users on their website can click your button to go to your site.
It’s fascinating to see how many buttons people create, the lengths they
go to in designing them, and especially how many buttons one will host
on their site. Some have easily over 50 links to their friends or sites
they enjoy visiting and I think this off-the-grid homebrewed way of
almost having a followers list is creative.</li> <li>Chat rooms: Chat rooms are also another pretty self-explanatory one.
You can join a chat room and often pick a name and profile picture.
These are a little more foreign to me as far as getting them on the site
and how third-party companies fit into the mix.</li> <li>Guest books: This one I also found very creative. Many sites have
what they call a “guest book” and it’s exactly what it would be in real
life. If you visit the website and so please, you can write a message
into the guestbook and leave a little mark of yourself. These often let
people link to their personal sites and give them the freedom to write
whatever they want. These come across as an almost comment-section
equivalent but have much less toxic communities (as far as I can
tell).</li> <li>Webrings: These are also very interesting but also don’t come off as
very “personal”. A webring is almost like joining a group of people who
have some commonality between themselves that will “join” a webring.
Some webring managers require forms to be filled out or applications to
be made, but essentially if you are part of a webring, you declare so on
your site and probably include some little bit of HTML into your site
that will be the actual webring. That bit of HTML will let anyone on
your site access the sites of other people in the same webring as you.
This can be great for small friend groups or even larger organizations,
but with the larger webrings, the sense of community disappears, as it’s
just a huge list of names that don’t have any organization or
relation.</li>`,k,l,S="Final thoughts",x,f,P=`Although I am hosting my site through the <a href="https://neocities.org">neocities</a> service, I was never on the
internet for this era of what neocities are trying to emulate so I can’t
relate to this style of web design, social interaction, and hobbying. I
think the little communities that people form are fun to poke around in
and I like the whole “independent from big tech” stance, but the style
just isn’t for me. The very pixelated, raw, and chaotic vibes of these
neocities collide completely with my appeal for simple and minimal
design. Also, there is just so much culture I don’t understand or relate
to so that’s why I think it would be really cool if there was a more
abstract way of socializing through personal websites on the
internet.`,T,p,N=`What I really mean is this (and this may already exist), but a common
way for more modern personal websites, personal blogging, and tech
enthusiasts to find each other’s websites in a way like neocities
offers. Number one, there’s the dense web of links, guest books, 88 x
31, and webrings that are present in neocities, but the content often
isn’t of interest to me. Number two, the neocities website offers a
great catalog of the sites that they host so it’s an easy-to-reach
central hub that will hold a bunch of neocities, making it really easy
to find one and start exploring. Other, non-neocity, personal websites
have links and webrings, but the really tough part is first finding one.
That’s where number two comes in, and I think a place where people could
index and catalog a bunch of personal websites would be a great idea and
get many more people excited about becoming their internet nomads.`;return{c(){s=r("h1"),s.textContent=_,g=d(),c=r("p"),c.innerHTML=j,b=d(),n=r("h2"),n.textContent=H,w=d(),m=r("p"),m.textContent=L,v=d(),a=r("ol"),a.innerHTML=M,k=d(),l=r("h2"),l.textContent=S,x=d(),f=r("p"),f.innerHTML=P,T=d(),p=r("p"),p.textContent=N,this.h()},l(e){s=h(e,"H1",{id:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),u(s)!=="svelte-omhvg"&&(s.textContent=_),g=y(e),c=h(e,"P",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),u(c)!=="svelte-cmvj7r"&&(c.innerHTML=j),b=y(e),n=h(e,"H2",{id:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),u(n)!=="svelte-jk3tol"&&(n.textContent=H),w=y(e),m=h(e,"P",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),u(m)!=="svelte-473u1d"&&(m.textContent=L),v=y(e),a=h(e,"OL",{type:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),u(a)!=="svelte-wymxg2"&&(a.innerHTML=M),k=y(e),l=h(e,"H2",{id:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),u(l)!=="svelte-1lpmuf1"&&(l.textContent=S),x=y(e),f=h(e,"P",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),u(f)!=="svelte-1j2m26n"&&(f.innerHTML=P),T=y(e),p=h(e,"P",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),u(p)!=="svelte-ktsp86"&&(p.textContent=N),this.h()},h(){C(s,"id","what-are-neocities"),C(n,"id","social-aspect"),C(a,"type","1"),C(l,"id","final-thoughts")},m(e,t){i(e,s,t),i(e,g,t),i(e,c,t),i(e,b,t),i(e,n,t),i(e,w,t),i(e,m,t),i(e,v,t),i(e,a,t),i(e,k,t),i(e,l,t),i(e,x,t),i(e,f,t),i(e,T,t),i(e,p,t)},p:I,i:I,o:I,d(e){e&&(o(s),o(g),o(c),o(b),o(n),o(w),o(m),o(v),o(a),o(k),o(l),o(x),o(f),o(T),o(p))}}}class J extends z{constructor(s){super(),A(this,s,null,G,q,{})}}export{J as component};
