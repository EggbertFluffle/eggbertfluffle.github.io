You can find a more detailed synopsis of myself in the &lt;WhoAmI\\&gt; section.

As of writing this, the site is absolutely a WIP but I think in time it should look much better. The site is written with <a href="https://kit.svelte.dev/">Svelte-Kit</a>, using a static adapter. There should be a place to preview projects and contact me but for now e-mail is fine (hdiambrosio@gmail.com). I encourage you to poke around or reach out, have a good day :)';return{c(){t=u("h1"),t.textContent=r,s=v(),i=u("p"),i.innerHTML=h,this.h()},l(e){t=c(e,"H1",{id:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),m(t)!=="svelte-1eaztqk"&&(t.textContent=r),s=k(e),i=c(e,"P",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),m(i)!=="svelte-1sjknak"&&(i.innerHTML=h),this.h()},h(){y(t,"id","introduction")},m(e,a){n(e,t,a),n(e,s,a),n(e,i,a)},p:o,i:o,o,d(e){e&&(l(t),l(s),l(i))}}}class b extends f{constructor(t){super(),g(this,t,null,I,p,{})}}export{b as component};
