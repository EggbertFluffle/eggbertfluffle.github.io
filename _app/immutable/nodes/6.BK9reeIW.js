I was originally planning to make an entire post just about that, but I kinda didn&#39;t do it. Essentially, it is a pretty simple Neovim plugin that makes it easy to incorporate audio cues into neovim. I do this for fun, but I can see this being useful for accecibility reasons or notifications, there are a lot of options. I have a demo and (hopefully) everything one would need to get beepboop.nvim up and running in their Neovim config on the <a href="https://github.com/EggbertFluffle/beepboop.nvim">GitHub repo</a>. I use it all the time, and am open to suggestions while the code is also completely open source, although I have never run an open source project and could really use a real reason to dig into git. Despite that, I&#39;m pretty proud of the state of beepboop.nvim and I received a lot of good feedback on Reddit when I made a post showing it to to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/1hqtyg5/make_neovim_noisy_with_beepboopnvim/">r/neovim</a>.',P,d,Q="Olivia",O,I,Z='Additionally, while I was home, my dad finally caved and let us get a cat.

Some things I have already made pretty good headway on. One of which was learning a bit about assembly language. To do this, I decided upon the <a href="https://flatassembler.net/">flat assembler</a> or fasm. It was really just the first one that I heard about, and would allow me to just start writing as soon as possible, even though eventually the boilerplate for the gnu assembler will be helpful to learn. I figured some things out and have a couple smaller projects to familiarize myself with how data is moved around, system calls are used, and how functions are generally executed. One of the cooler pet projects I made was a small working shell! I don&#39;t have it hosted remotely, but if anyone wants access to it, just shoot me an email!',D,C,ne="The big ticket item though is the chat app I want to put together. I've gotten into messaging recently, and looked into services like matrix and irc, from which the latter stuck as something I use semi-regularly! It's actually a lot of fun too. I've figured out znc as a bouncer and how to use weechat as my client. I'm only on libera right now, but the communities they have there are so knoledgable, I don't see myself needing much more than what they have already. As you can probably see where this is going, I want to build my own chat app, but in assembly, and no C library. I think (hope) it will be a good learning oppourtunity, interfacing with the unix socket api through system calls.",Y,_,se='I have already started progress... kinda. I figured since I&#39;ve never used the socket api before, it would be beneficial for me to build a chat app where I have access to the C library and all the functions that make the general process a little easier, so I did it in C. This also let me figure out the general order of operations for a server that is connecting with multiple clients and interfacing between all of them at once. Irc was again a super useful resource for this but somone on #c reccommended <a href="https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/">Beej&#39;s Guide to Network Programming</a>. Beej did a fantastic job at making network programming approachable, and make sense to read about. One thing I&#39;ve learned to love is when teachers remind you that they are human too, by having an interesting personality or showing a general enthusiasm for the topic they are lecturing on. Beej does this by being corny or making a funny analogy, but it really makes the material easier to digest. So with all these amazing resources, I finally put together the chat app in C, which can be found on my GitHub <a href="https://github.com/EggbertFluffle/c_chat_app">here</a>.',z,T,le="This is about where I am now, and I need to figure out how to do some of the basics in assembly without the C library like managing structs, arrays, integer parsing, reversing the order of bytes, et cetera.

System&#39;s is fine, but I&#39;m already pretty familliar with the material. Discrete Mathematics however, is one of the most interesting classes I&#39;ve taken here. It&#39;s completely foreign to any &quot;math&quot; I&#39;ve done before, but everything lines up nicely and it makes me approach problems far differently than before, which I always love. I&#39;ve also always wanted to collect two books just because of how much I hear about them in the computing scene, but now I only want to collect one. I just got my hand on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns">Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software</a> for only $2.00!

Besides all that nonsense, myself and some friends are plotting to participate in the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/brackeys-13">Brackey&#39;s Game Jam</a> this Saturday, and I&#39;ve been thinking about making a devlog about it and posting it on YouTube, but that does seem like a lot of work concerning recording and editing, which I don&#39;t know how to do.
