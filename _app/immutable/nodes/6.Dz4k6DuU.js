scattered to put together a “cohesive” post, but I figured “eh, i dont

little</em></strong>. My last post was on the Advent of Code, which I
had a <em>LOT</em> of fun doing, and I’m very thankful to everyone who
participated with me, especially <a href="https://www.onocu.com">_Orange</a>! Since that, I enjoyed the

working state (shocker), was <a href="https://github.com/EggbertFluffle/beepboop.nvim">beepboop.nvim</a>.
I was origionally planning to make an entire post just about that, but I
kinda didn’t do it. Essentially it is a pretty simple Neovim plugin that
makes it easy to incorporate audio cues into neovim. I do this for fun,
but I can see this being useful for accecibility reasons or
notifications, there are a lot of options. I have a demo and (hopefully)
everything one would need to get beepboop.nvim up and running in their
Neovim config ont he (GitHub
repo[(https://github.com/EggbertFluffle/beepboop.nvim]. I really love
it, use it all the time, and am open to suggestions and the code is
completely open source, although I have never ran an open source project
and could really use a real reason to dig into git. Despite that, I’m
pretty proud of the state of beepboop.nvim and I received a lot of good
feedback on Reddit when I made a post to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/1hqtyg5/make_neovim_noisy_with_beepboopnvim/">r/neovim</a>.`,S,m,V="Olivia",O,b,Z=`Additionally, while I was home, my dad finaly caved and let us get a
cat. Now we are the proud owners of Olivia, a beautiful tuxedo cat that
we adopted from the <a href="https://cliftonanimalshelter.com/">Clifton
Animal Shelter</a>. She initially did <em>eveything</em> in my room for
about a week, but then we got her used to the rest of the house. It’s
always nice hearing her playing with some random toy at 2AM or sleeping
wherever she pleases during the entire day. Of course I need to leave
some pictures so enjoy!`,B,v,ee='<img src="/images/olivia_trex.jpg" alt="Olivia T-Rex"/> <img src="/images/olivia_woah.jpg" alt="Olivia Woah"/> <img src="/images/olivia_eepington.jpg" alt="Olivia Sleeping"/> <img src="/images/olivia_tupperware.jpg" alt="Olivia Being Tupperwear"/>',E,d,te="New Year’s Resolutions!",q,w,ie="I have none!",A,p,ae="Things I want to do in 2025",N,I,ne=`I hope this is somehow different than New Year’s resolutions, but
there are some things I’d like to do this year at some point. Some
things I have already made pretty good headway on. One of which was
learning a bit about assembly language. To do this, I decided upon the
<a href="https://flatassembler.net/">flat assembler</a> or fasm. It was
really just the first one that I heard about, and would allow me to just
start writing as soon as possible, even though eventually the
boilerplate will be important to learn. I figured some things out and
have a couple smaller projects to familliarize myself with how data is
moved around, system calls are used, and how functions are generally
executed. One of the cooler pet projects I made was a small working
shell! I don’t have it hosted remotely, but if anyone wants access to
it, just shoot me an email!`,D,k,oe=`The big ticket item though is the chat app I want to put together.
I’ve gotten into messaging recently, and looked into services like
matrix and irc, which the latter stuck as something I use
semi-regularly! It’s actually a lot of fun too. I’ve figured out a znc
as a bouncer and how to use weechat as my client. I’m only on libera
right now, but the communities they have there are so knoledgable, I
don’t see myself needing much more than what they have already. As you
can probably see where this is going, I want to build my own chat app,
but in assembly. I think (hope) it will be a good learning oppourtunity,
interfacing with the unix socket api through system calls.`,F,x,le=`I have already started progress… kinda. I figured since I’ve never
used the socket api before, it would be beneficial for me to build a
chat app where I have access to the C library and all the functions that
make the general process a little easier. This also let me figure out
the general order of operations for a server that is connecting with
multiple clients and interfacing between all of them at once. Irc was
again a super useful resource for this but somone on #c reccommended <a href="https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/">Beej’s Guide to Network
Programming</a>. Beej did a fantastic job at making network programming
approachable, make sense and interesting to read about. One thing I’ve
learned to love is when teacher remind you that they are human too, and
have an interesting personality. Beej does this by being corny or making
a funny analogy, but it really makes the material easier to digest. So
with all these amazing resources, I finnally put together the chat app
in C, which can be found on my GitHub <a href="https://github.com/EggbertFluffle/c_chat_app">here</a>.`,G,C,se=`This is about where I am now, and I need to figure out how to do some
of the basics in assembly without the C library like managing structs,
arrays, integer parsing, reversing the order of bytes, et cetera. I will
probably post about the assembly chat app when it’s finished but It’s
taking a quick hiatus while I have some other big ticket items on my
list.`,R,y,re="New Keeb",Y,_,he=`Not really much to say here. Had been wanting a new keyboard for a
while now and finnaly decided to stop being to frugal and do some good
research. I origionally wanted a standard kit that just looked nice, but
I eventually thought “I’ll probably be typing until I get my government
issue neuralink”, so I opted for a <strong>split keyboard</strong>.
Simply, it is the <a href="https://keeb.io/products/iris-keyboard-split-ergonomic-keyboard">Iris

new keycap set, courteous of a good ol’ secret santa.`,z,j,ue=`<img src="/images/my_beloved_keyboard.jpg" alt="Beutifully immaculate split keybaord"/> <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Beutifully immaculate split

mention. I’ve started the C term as a student at WPI and I’ve been
taking System’s Programming and Discrete Mathematics. System’s is find,
but I’m already pretty familliar with the material. Discrete Mathematics
however, is one of the most interesting classes I’ve taking here. It’s
completely foreign to any “math” I’ve done before, but everything lines
up nicely and it makes me approach problems far differently than before,
which I always love. I’ve also always wanted to collect two books (and
maybe read them) just because of how much I hear about them in the
computing scene, but now I only want to collect one. I just got my hand
on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns">Design
Patterns: Elements of Reusable Objest-Oriented Software</a> for only
$2.00! Such a steal, and I will absolutely be chipping away at it
throughout the year. Besides all that nonsense, myself and some friends
are plotting to participate in the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/brackeys-13">Brackey’s Game Jam</a> this
Saturday, and I’ve been thinking about making a devlog about it and
posting it on YouTube, but that does seem like a lot of work concerning
recording and editing, which I don’t know how to do. I’m really excited
because we have a musician, and artist and two programmers, so I’m
hoping we can pump out something really cool! Until next time, who needs
outros for blogs.`;return{c(){h=n("h1"),h.textContent=K,M=s(),f=n("p"),f.innerHTML=X,L=s(),u=n("h2"),u.textContent=$,P=s(),c=n("p"),c.innerHTML=Q,S=s(),m=n("h2"),m.textContent=V,O=s(),b=n("p"),b.innerHTML=Z,B=s(),v=n("p"),v.innerHTML=ee,E=s(),d=n("h2"),d.textContent=te,q=s(),w=n("p"),w.textContent=ie,A=s(),p=n("h2"),p.textContent=ae,N=s(),I=n("p"),I.innerHTML=ne,D=s(),k=n("p"),k.textContent=oe,F=s(),x=n("p"),x.innerHTML=le,G=s(),C=n("p"),C.textContent=se,R=s(),y=n("h2"),y.textContent=re,Y=s(),_=n("p"),_.innerHTML=he,z=s(),j=n("figure"),j.innerHTML=ue,U=s(),g=n("h2"),g.textContent=me,W=s(),T=n("p"),T.innerHTML=de,this.h()},l(e){h=o(e,"H1",{id:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),l(h)!=="svelte-1pww30r"&&(h.textContent=K),M=r(e),f=o(e,"P",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),l(f)!=="svelte-1q7m9d1"&&(f.innerHTML=X),L=r(e),u=o(e,"H2",{id:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),l(u)!=="svelte-14h99y"&&(u.textContent=$),P=r(e),c=o(e,"P",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),l(c)!=="svelte-1y3gynd"&&(c.innerHTML=Q),S=r(e),m=o(e,"H2",{id:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),l(m)!=="svelte-vyyxy2"&&(m.textContent=V),O=r(e),b=o(e,"P",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),l(b)!=="svelte-17n00tp"&&(b.innerHTML=Z),B=r(e),v=o(e,"P",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),l(v)!=="svelte-k8gp8k"&&(v.innerHTML=ee),E=r(e),d=o(e,"H2",{id:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),l(d)!=="svelte-148lkdo"&&(d.textContent=te),q=r(e),w=o(e,"P",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),l(w)!=="svelte-1svbh8y"&&(w.textContent=ie),A=r(e),p=o(e,"H2",{id:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),l(p)!=="svelte-ygqhs2"&&(p.textContent=ae),N=r(e),I=o(e,"P",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),l(I)!=="svelte-12olims"&&(I.innerHTML=ne),D=r(e),k=o(e,"P",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),l(k)!=="svelte-hfjmy1"&&(k.textContent=oe),F=r(e),x=o(e,"P",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),l(x)!=="svelte-i1ak5r"&&(x.innerHTML=le),G=r(e),C=o(e,"P",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),l(C)!=="svelte-1tqu8by"&&(C.textContent=se),R=r(e),y=o(e,"H2",{id:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),l(y)!=="svelte-j4sl5"&&(y.textContent=re),Y=r(e),_=o(e,"P",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),l(_)!=="svelte-jabpoj"&&(_.innerHTML=he),z=r(e),j=o(e,"FIGURE",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),l(j)!=="svelte-1297ewi"&&(j.innerHTML=ue),U=r(e),g=o(e,"H2",{id:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),l(g)!=="svelte-1sdahnp"&&(g.textContent=me),W=r(e),T=o(e,"P",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),l(T)!=="svelte-kiq5c1"&&(T.innerHTML=de),this.h()},h(){H(h,"id","hello-is-anyone-there"),H(u,"id","beepboop.nvim"),H(m,"id","olivia"),H(d,"id","new-years-resolutions"),H(p,"id","things-i-want-to-do-in-2025"),H(y,"id","new-keeb"),H(g,"id","its-the-little-things")},m(e,t){i(e,h,t),i(e,M,t),i(e,f,t),i(e,L,t),i(e,u,t),i(e,P,t),i(e,c,t),i(e,S,t),i(e,m,t),i(e,O,t),i(e,b,t),i(e,B,t),i(e,v,t),i(e,E,t),i(e,d,t),i(e,q,t),i(e,w,t),i(e,A,t),i(e,p,t),i(e,N,t),i(e,I,t),i(e,D,t),i(e,k,t),i(e,F,t),i(e,x,t),i(e,G,t),i(e,C,t),i(e,R,t),i(e,y,t),i(e,Y,t),i(e,_,t),i(e,z,t),i(e,j,t),i(e,U,t),i(e,g,t),i(e,W,t),i(e,T,t)},p:J,i:J,o:J,d(e){e&&(a(h),a(M),a(f),a(L),a(u),a(P),a(c),a(S),a(m),a(O),a(b),a(B),a(v),a(E),a(d),a(q),a(w),a(A),a(p),a(N),a(I),a(D),a(k),a(F),a(x),a(G),a(C),a(R),a(y),a(Y),a(_),a(z),a(j),a(U),a(g),a(W),a(T))}}}class we extends ge{constructor(h){super(),fe(this,h,null,ce,ye,{})}}export{we as component};
