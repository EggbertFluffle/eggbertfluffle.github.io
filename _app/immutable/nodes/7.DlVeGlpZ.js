detailed synopsis of myself in the &lt;WhoAmI&gt; section. I plan to
just use this as a place to throw in things that I’m working on, cool
stuff I’m studying or really anything else I feel like writing about. As
of writing this the site is defenitly a WIP but I think in time it
should look much better. The site is written with <a href="https://kit.svelte.dev/">Svelte-Kit</a>, using a static adapter.
There should be a place to preview projects and contact me but for now
e-mail is fine (hdiambrosio@gmail.com). I encourage you to poke around
